## circuit-scala

The CircuitBreaker is used to provide stability and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

### How do you use this

```javascript
let circuit = new CircuitBreaker(
  maxFailures: Number, // How many consecutive errors before opening the circuit breaker, like 25
  resetTimeout: String, // A Time Period like '10 seconds'
  exponentialBackoffFactor: Number  = 1 // On What Exponential Scaling default in 1 so it stays the same each time
  maxResetTimeout: String = '10 minutes' // Maximum Reset Timeout, 
  // if exponentialBackoff is set above 1 what is the maximum time
)

circuit.protect(() => fetch('http://example.com/movies.json'))
```

### Purpose

As an example, we have a web application interacting with a remote third party web service. Letâ€™s say the third party has oversold their capacity and their database melts down under load. Assume that the database fails in such a way that it takes a very long time to hand back an error to the third party web service. This in turn makes calls fail after a long period of time. Back to our web application, the users have noticed that their form submissions take much longer seeming to hang. Well the users do what they know to do which is use the refresh button, adding more requests to their already running requests. This eventually causes the failure of the web application due to resource exhaustion. This will affect all users, even those who are not using functionality dependent on this third party web service.

Introducing circuit breakers on the web service call would cause the requests to begin to fail-fast, letting the user know that something is wrong and that they need not refresh their request. This also confines the failure behavior to only those users that are using functionality dependent on the third party, other users are no longer affected as there is no resource exhaustion. Circuit breakers can also allow savvy developers to mark portions of the site that use the functionality unavailable, or perhaps show some cached content as appropriate while the breaker is open.

This works equally well for browser calls where some failure state is occuring in the remote server.


### How It Works

The circuit breaker models a concurrent state machine that
can be in any of these 3 states:

**Closed**: During normal operations or when the `CircuitBreaker` starts

- Exceptions increment the `failures` counter

- Successes reset the failure count to zero

- When the `failures` counter reaches the `maxFailures` count,the breaker is tripped into `Open` state

**Open**: The circuit breaker rejects all tasks with an RejectedExecution

- all tasks fail fast with `RejectedExecution`

- after the configured `resetTimeout`, the circuit breaker enters a `HalfOpen` state, allowing one task to go through for testing the connection

**HalfOpen**: The circuit breaker has already allowed a task to go through, as a reset attempt, in order to test the connection

- The first task when `Open` has expired is allowed through without failing fast, just before the circuit breaker is evolved into the `HalfOpen` state

- All tasks attempted in `HalfOpen` fail-fast with an exception just as in `Open` state

- If that task attempt succeeds, the breaker is reset back to the `Closed` state, with the `resetTimeout` and the `failures` count also reset to initial values

- If the first call fails, the breaker is tripped again into the `Open` state (the `resetTimeout` is multiplied by the exponential backoff factor)
